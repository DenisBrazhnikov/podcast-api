# Introduction
Create an API to manage a podcast’s episodes. The minimum requirements for this API would
be to allow a user to add new episodes to a podcast and list all existing ones.
# Requirements
    * Create new episode
    * List all episodes
    * JSON requests & responses
    * Store episodes in Amazon S3 (or for demo purposes use ‘DigitalOcean Spaces’ which is
    S3 compatible & easier to set up)
    * Tests
    * Version Controlled (Github/BitBucket)
    * Framework - Preferrably Symfony or Laravel.
# Episode minimum attributes
    * Id
    * Download url
    * Title
    * Description
    * Episode number
    * Created date
# Potential Extras
    * Update episode metadata
    * Remove episode
# Desirable
    * Run config (docker/vagrant)
    * Structure should be the same thinking of a bigger project
    * Good API Design
